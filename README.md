This is a GitOps/Declarative way of working with Veracode through configuration.

The advantages of working in a GitOps style
- Allows a development team to onboard themselves into Veracode in a change controlled manner.
- All of your configuration is in source control, including module selection.
- Modifying your Veracode configuration can occur just within the config file, no need to login to the Veracode platform.
- Either work from a single centralized configuration, or a distributed configuration accross many repositories.
